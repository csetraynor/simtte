Title: Simulation of time-to-event models
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Carlos S Traynor [aut, cre]
Maintainer: Carlos S Traynor <c.traynor@warwick.ac.uk>
Description: The goal of simtte is to fast simulate simple and complex time-to-event models also known as survival analysis.
    It also allows user-defined time-to-event models.
    Defines a model using the hazard function and the Kolmogorov differential equation.
    Samples a dataset using inverse transform sampling.
    Default models for Weibull, M-splines and B-splines.
