# simtte

Allows to simulate bespoke time-to-event models.
Hazard models that are default given are Weibull and M-splines distribution.
Other bespoke models can be coded in **mrgsolve** and the same workhorse function can be used to simulate the time-to-event prediction via inverse transform sampling.
