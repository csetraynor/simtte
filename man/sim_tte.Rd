\title{Simulate time-to-event
Main function of \code{simtte}. Simulates a time-to-event dataset,
also known as survival dataset. It can simulate parametric models Weibull and exponential
and splines models.}
\usage{
sim_tte(pi, log_pi = TRUE, mu = -3, coefs = 0, basis = NULL,
  time = 100, end_time, type = "weibull", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{pi}{prognostic index in the relative hazard for each individual.
Given a matrix of measurements X and a vector of hazard coefficients b,
the \code{pi} is given by the matrix multiplication.
assuming a linear hazard model. \code{pi} is also known as linear predictor.}

\item{log_pi}{Is the prognostic index in the log-scale defulat \code{TRUE}.}

\item{mu}{The intercept of the model for Weibull and ex}

\item{coefs}{For M-splines and B-slines model the coefficient of each spline.}

\item{basis}{the basis matrix for splines models.}

\item{time}{For M-splines the times corresponding to the basis matrix, ignored for the Weibull.}

\item{end_time}{Administrative censoring time, or \code{max(times)}.}

\item{type}{Either type Weibull or M-splines.}

\item{...}{Parameters passed to mrgsolve mrgsim function.}
