\title{Simulate time-to-event dataframe
This function can be used to use inverse transform sampling from a
cosutmised time-to-event model implemented in **mrgsolve**.
One only needs to pass the dataframe and the state variable
the probability to remain alive, by default p11.}
\usage{
sim_tte_df(dat, surv_var = "p11", id_var = "ID", xdata = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{The mrgsim output dataframe.}

\item{surv_var}{the state probability to remain with no event , default to p11.}

\item{id_var}{ID vaiable default to ID.}

\item{xdata}{additional covariate data to pass to the final dataframe.
Must have the same \code{id_var} as \code{dat}.
@export}
